# sample-widget
A sample react-bootstrap with scroll drag

I made this project with NodeJS and ReactJS (create-react-app).

using npm

create-react-app name-of-your-project
cd name-of-your-project

and inserted 3 libraries:

npm install jquery --save
npm install bootstrap --save 
npm install dragscroll --save

to see this sample in action you must 
copy this src and public folders, replace its original files created by create-react-app

and finally, to run it just type

yarn start (to start the server)
